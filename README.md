# N - Puzzle



## Problem and Goal

The n-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing. The puzzle can be of any size, with the most common sizes being $3 \times 3$ and $4 \times 4$. The objective of the puzzle is to rearrange the tiles to form a specific pattern, such as the numbers in numerical order.



## Solutions

This project has implemented the N-Puzzle problem using Python and has created a graphical user interface using PyQt5. Specifically, the project focused on analyzing the 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 puzzles and implemented DFS, BFS, A* and IDA* algorithms to solve them. The project also analyzed the performance of the A* algorithm and implemented different heuristic functions such as Manhattan Distance, Euclidean Distance and Linear Conflict + Manhattan Distance to optimize its performance.
